# Movie Notes

### _A movie review website for movie lovers_
_As a movie person, I was thinking about why there is no website for logging and sharing reviews in Taiwan. 
Then I saw my girl friend using a Japanese website for reviewing books and it has some basic social features.
Voila, this project was born!_
